Software for sensors networked over RS485, worker and coordinator

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS. NOTHING USABLE RIGHT NOW.
The coordinator comes in two versions:
- a test coordinator connected to networked workers via soft serial
- a normal coordinator connected to networked workers via hardware serial


Worker software tested on Arduino Nano, the old one with cheap clones available.

Coordinator software tested on Arduino Uno V3.
